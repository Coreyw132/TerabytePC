                <h3>Corey Williams</h3>
                <p><strong>Founder & Technician</strong></p>
                <p>Founder and owner of Terabyte PC and Parts LLC, a veteran-owned technology business based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. With a lifelong passion for gaming and technology, Corey’s journey to starting his business is one marked by perseverance, self-discovery, and a deep commitment to family and community. <br>
                    Growing up in a single-parent home, Corey faced financial hardships that kept him from accessing the gaming world he loved. Despite these challenges, his passion for technology grew, and as a teenager, he began to immerse himself in building and customizing computers as a hobby. Over time, his knowledge and skills expanded, and he became the go-to person for friends and family seeking technology advice. This naturally led to building and selling computers for fun, and eventually, the idea of turning his passion into a business took root. <br>
                    <br>
                    Corey’s path was not without struggles. After high school, he worked in high-end remodeling and new home construction before enlisting in the United States Air Force as a Special Forces Parachute Rigger. During his service, he worked alongside some of the greatest heroes of our time, experiencing firsthand the challenges and triumphs that make up the stories often seen in movies. However, a series of injuries ultimately forced Corey into early retirement, leaving him permanently disabled. <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite these setbacks, Corey remained determined to find his purpose. He returned to Oklahoma with his wife and children for family support and began channeling his energy into learning more about technology. His interest in game development grew, leading him to code for GTA V roleplay servers. Corey eventually decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science, focusing on Software Engineering, to formalize his knowledge and expand his technical expertise.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through countless hours of research and hands-on experience, Corey realized that there was a lack of knowledgeable, customer-focused tech stores in his area. Driven by the desire to provide a service that truly meets the needs of technology enthusiasts, gamers, and the community, he launched Terabyte PC and Parts LLC. <br>
                    <br>
                    At the heart of Corey’s mission is his unwavering dedication to family values. He attributes his success to the love and support of his wife and children, who have stood by him through every challenge. This deep appreciation for family drives Corey to treat everyone he interacts with as if they were part of his own. Whether it’s a customer, a partner, or a member of the community, Corey believes in building genuine relationships and offering the same respect, care, and attention he would give to his own family.<br>
                    <br>
                    Corey’s mission is to offer expert guidance and top-quality custom PC solutions, making technology accessible and understandable for everyone. His dedication to customer service, community support, and creating opportunities for young people to engage with technology is at the core of his business. <br>
                    <br>
                    With Terabyte PC and Parts LLC, Corey is not just building a business—he’s creating a hub for the community to come together, learn, and experience the power of custom-built technology, all while fostering a welcoming environment where everyone is treated like family. <br>

                <h3>Joby Leiser</h3>
                <p><strong>Senior Technician</strong></p>
                <p>a passionate tech enthusiast with a deep love for gaming PCs and cars. Born and raised in a small town in Pennsylvania, Joby developed an early interest in technology and performance machines. After serving for eight years in the military, he decided to transition into a new chapter of life and moved to Oklahoma.

                    <br>
                    Joby’s dedication to both his craft and his friends is evident in everything he does, whether it’s tweaking PC builds to perfection or gaming in his spare time. His combination of military discipline, technical expertise, and passion for gaming has made him a vital asset to Terabyte PCs. When he’s not fine-tuning computers or gaming, you can often find him hanging out with friends.<br> </p>
